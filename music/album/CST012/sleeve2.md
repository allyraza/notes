dearest THE CITIZEN of falling/fallen world--

this tape recording was a broken road. & in the end, it was just a
tentative stagger towards the pale&holy FADING light... (IT WAS A COLD
AND LONELY WINTER.)

SO: this tape recording is the last stanza of a 3page chapter; we
dedicate this stanza to quiet refusals, loud refusals and sad refusals.
we dedicate it to every prisoner in the world... (we dedicate it to
empty streets at dawn.) (wet streets...)
