4\. 27 JEREMIAH

23 I beheld the earth,  
And, lo, it was waste and void;  
And the heavens, and they had  
no light.

24 I beheld they mountains, and, lo,  
they trembled,  
And all the hills moved to and  
fro.

25 I beheld, and, lo, there was no  
man,  
And all the birds of the heavens  
were fled.

26 I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful field  
was a wilderness,  
And all the cities thereof were  
broken down  
At the presence of the LORD,  
And before His fierce anger.

27 For thus saith the LORD:  
The whole land shall be desolate;  
Yet will I not make a full end.
