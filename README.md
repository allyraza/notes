# Album Notes

Transcriptions of album notes & lyrics.

## Organization

Each album is contained in a directory named by the catalog number of
the release. All catalog numbers are in all capitals.

Inside each directory is an `index.md` Markdown file containing the
artist name as a first-level heading and album name as a second-level
heading.

Any short transcriptions are contained in the `index.md` file itself,
under a third-level heading and enclosed in block-quote.

Longer transcriptions are contained in separate Markdown files in the
album directory without extra formatting, and are linked to as
third-level headings in the index Markdown file.

No content in this repository other than this file belongs to me. I've
just transcribed it from album copies I own. I don't know how legal it
is to host these transcriptions here.
